            <h5 class="text-warning">Question-1: What's the difference between local storage and session storage?
            </h5>
            <p>Answer: The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how
                long
                the data is saved for and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is destroyed once the user
                closes the browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.

            <h5 class="text-warning">Question-2: What's the difference between global scope and block scope?</h5>
            <p>Answer: The main difference between the global scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g.
                if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect,
                because the variables are still in the same scope. ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const
                keywords. <br>

            <h5 class="text-warning">Question-3: What is Event Loop in JavaScript? How does it works? </h5>
            <p>Answer: The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an
                asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event
                loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed.<br>

            <h5 class="text-warning">Question-4: How many ways to get undefined in JavaScript? </h5>
            <p>Answer: 8 ways to get undefined in JavaScript. <br>
                These ways are given below: <br>
                1. If you want to display the value of a variable without initializing it. <br>
                2. If a function is called with a value but nothing is returned from that function, it will return
                undefined. <br>
                3. It returns undefined by default if no property exists in the object. <br>
                4. It returns undefined if an index is accessed or accessed without assigning a value to it. <br>
                4. If the function does not return the correct object, it will return undefined. <br>
                5. If no value is given to the parameter it will be undefined. <br>
                6. If the function does not return the correct object, it will return undefined. <br>
                7. If something's value is set to undefined , then undefined is returned from it. <br>
                8. If one of its elements is deleted, it becomes undefined. <br>
